Advantages of java Configurations vs XML config:
=====================================
Java is type safe. Compiler will report issues if you are configuring right bean class qualifiers.
XML based on configuration can quickly grow big. [Yes we can split and import but still]
Search is much simpler, refactoring will be bliss. Finding a bean definition will be far easier.
There are still people who like XML configuration and continue to do it.
